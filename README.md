A plugin for Lite XL that generates project templates for programming languages.

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment this plugin is LINUX ONLY

> [!WARNING]
> At the moment the functionality for downloading dependency is broken, a FIX is WIP

> [!WARNING]
> At the moment the command running functionality is broken because of a (possible) bug in the `terminal` plugin.
> So the scripts will need to be assigned exec properties manually with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`
